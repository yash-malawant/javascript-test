// Sure! Here are simple answers for some common Director Round questions:

// 1. Technical & Project-Related Questions

// Q: Can you tell me about a difficult project you worked on?
// A: Yes, I worked on a project where we had to build a React Native app with many real-time features. The biggest challenge was managing app performance. I solved this by optimizing API calls, using caching, and reducing unnecessary re-renders.

// Q: How do you improve performance in a React Native app?
// A: I optimize images, reduce unnecessary re-renders, use FlatList for long lists, and avoid using heavy third-party libraries. Also, I use React Nativeâ€™s useMemo and useCallback to improve speed.

// Q: How do you handle a slow API response in your app?
// A: I use loading indicators to show users that the data is coming. I also use retry logic for failed requests and cache data so the app works even when offline.

// 2. Problem-Solving & Decision-Making

// Q: What will you do if your app crashes after an update?
// A: First, I check error logs using tools like Sentry or Firebase Crashlytics. Then, I test the app to find the issue. If needed, I roll back the update and release a quick fix.

// Q: If you have a deadline and multiple tasks, how do you handle it?
// A: I prioritize the tasks based on urgency and impact. I break them into smaller steps and focus on one thing at a time. If needed, I communicate with the team to adjust deadlines.

// 3. Leadership & Ownership

// Q: Have you helped a junior developer? How?
// A: Yes, I helped a junior developer understand React Native best practices. I explained concepts in simple terms, shared useful resources, and reviewed their code to give feedback.

// Q: How do you ensure your team follows best coding practices?
// A: I follow best practices myself and encourage code reviews. We use ESLint and Prettier to maintain clean code. Also, I suggest writing reusable components and avoiding unnecessary complexity.

// 4. Business & Vision Alignment

// Q: Why do you want to work in this company?
// A: I like this company because it builds great products and values innovation. I believe my skills in React Native can help improve the apps, and I can also learn new things here.

// Q: Where do you see yourself in 3-5 years?
// A: I want to grow as a Senior React Native Developer and take more responsibility in leading projects. I also want to improve my skills in system design and team management.

// 5. Behavioral Questions

// Q: What do you do if you have a conflict with a teammate?
// A: I try to understand their point of view and discuss the issue calmly. If needed, I involve a senior or manager to find a fair solution.

// Q: How do you handle criticism or feedback?
// A: I take feedback as a way to improve. If someone points out a mistake, I fix it and learn from it. I believe feedback helps me grow as a developer.
